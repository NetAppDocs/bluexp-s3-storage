. In the Add bucket page, enter the required information to create the bucket and click *Apply*.
+
.. Enter the name you want to use for the bucket.
.. Select the AWS account that will be the owner of the bucket. This can be the primary account where the Connector was deployed, or it can be a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-credentials-to-a-connector[different account that you have added to BlueXP^].
.. Select the AWS region where the bucket will be created.
.. Optionally, you can enable S3 object locking on the bucket to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. If you plan to use object locking, you must enable it when creating the bucket. Enabling Object Lock also enables Versioning. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html[Learn more about object locking from the Amazon S3 documentation^].
+
The bucket is created.

.What's next

You can't manually configure Versioning, Tags, or Encryption when initially adding a bucket. After the bucket is created you can configure these other properties of the bucket. link:task-change-s3-bucket-settings.html[Learn more about changing bucket settings].
