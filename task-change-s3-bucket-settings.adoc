Once your Amazon S3 working environment is available in the Canvas, you can change some bucket properties directly from BlueXP.

Note that you can't change the bucket name, AWS account, region, or object lock setting.

The bucket properties you can change include:

* Whether Versioning is enabled or disabled for all objects in the bucket.
* You can choose to apply tags Tags to the objects added to the bucket.
* Whether or not new objects added to the bucket are Encrypted, and the option used for encryption.

You can change these bucket settings directly from BlueXP by clicking image:button-horizontal-more.gif[the three dots more button] > *Manage details* for a bucket.

== Change the versioning setting

Versioning enables you to keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket so that you can restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten. You can change the versioning setting for future objects when they are added to the bucket. Changing the versioning setting does not change the value for existing objects.

Versioning is disabled by default in new buckets created by BlueXP, unless you enabled Object Lock when you created the bucket. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html[Learn more about versioning from the Amazon S3 documentation^].

Once enabled, if you want to stop versioning temporarily or permanently, you can choose the "Suspended" state. You can't disable versioning once it has been enabled.

== Change the tagging setting

Tags are metadata that you can use to group resources to identify applications, environments, regions, cloud providers, and more. Tags consists of a tag key and a tag value. You can add tags to a bucket so that the tags are applied to objects when they are added to the bucket. You can also change and delete tags and tag values.

Tags are disabled by default in new buckets created by BlueXP. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html[Learn more about tagging from the Amazon S3 documentation^].

After you add a tag, click *Add new tag* to add another tag - up to 10 per bucket.

== Change the encryption setting

Server-side encryption enables you to encrypt data at the Amazon S3 destination. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disk, and it decrypts it for you when you access it. You can change the encryption setting used for future objects when they are added to the bucket.

Encryption is enabled by default using "Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)"" in new buckets created by BlueXP. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html[Learn more about server-side encryption from the Amazon S3 documentation^].

You can choose to enable encryption using "KMS keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)" or by using your own "customer-provided keys (SSE-C)".
