Once your Amazon S3 working environment is available in the Canvas, you can edit some bucket properties directly from BlueXP.

You can see details about your S3 buckets, including the region, access policy, account, total and used capacity, and more. These buckets can be used as destinations for Cloud Backup, Cloud Tiering, or Cloud Sync operations. Additionally, you can use Cloud Data Sense to scan these buckets.
