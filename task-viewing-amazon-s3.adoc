After you install a Connector in AWS, BlueXP can automatically discover information about the Amazon S3 buckets that reside in the AWS account where the Connector is installed. An Amazon S3 working environment is added to the Canvas so you can view this information.

You can see details about your S3 buckets, including the region, access policy, account, total and used capacity, and more. These buckets can be used as destinations for Cloud Backup, Cloud Tiering, or Cloud Sync operations. Additionally, you can use Cloud Data Sense to scan these buckets.
